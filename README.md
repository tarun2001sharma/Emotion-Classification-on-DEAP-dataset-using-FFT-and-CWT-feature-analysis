# Emotion-Classification-on-DEAP-dataset-using-FFT-and-CWT-feature-analysis

The DEAP dataset provides a rich resource for research in
affective computing, allowing for the analysis of emotions using EEG,
physiological and video signals. In order to categorise EEG signals for

emotion analysis, this paper looks into the use of machine learning meth-
ods and signal processing techniques. In order to create a machine learn-
ing (ML) model that can accurately categorise EEG signals, we employ

feature extraction techniques like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). We will also investigate the effec-
tiveness of various machine learning algorithms at categorising emotions.

By contrasting the results of the ML model with human annotations, we
will assess the effectiveness of the model. In order to classify emotions
accurately in real time, we will implement the ML model for Emotion
Classification. This research may aid in the creation of trustworthy and
efficient EEG-based emotion analysis systems, which may find use in
fields like psychology, medicine, and human-computer interaction.
